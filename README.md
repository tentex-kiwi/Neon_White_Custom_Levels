# Custom Levels in Neon White

Welcome to the \***\*first\*\*** edition of custom levels in Neon White!

This version is a demonstration of the current knowledge I have gained, allowing for the removal of assets and moving assets within levels.

As part of this demonstration, I have put together a showcase of some hard to get to spots in levels, along with a few other challenges to inspire others!

## Prerequisites

None! These custom levels can be played in the default game!

## Getting Started

This section will go over how to get the modded levels in your own game.

1. **Make a copy of your current save data**
   - You probably don't want to lose all your current save data, so you should back it up.
   - Save data can be found at `H:\Users\<USER>\AppData\LocalLow\Little Flag Software, LLC\`, where `H` is the drive you use and `<USER>` is your local user on the computer.
   - A quick way to get here is `windows key + r` and typing in `%appdata%`, then going up a level.
2. **Make a copy of the levels without modifications**
   - The levels are read independent of your save, so if you mod the levels they will still be modded even if you start a new game
     - **IF** you do need to get the default levels back, verify game file integrity through steam.
   - levels can be found in the location of the game's download.
   - The path might look something like `H:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Neon White\Neon White_Data\` where `H` is the drive you use.
   - I don't want someone to accidentally cheat by running a level that has fewer enemies than they are supposed to, so **PLEASE** remember to change your levels back to the normal ones before doing runs.
3. **Replace your save data with the save file provided in this repo**
   - I have provided a save file that has completed the game but collected no presents. This is needed so that all of the presents are available for collection
4. **Copy over the levels in custom_levels to your levels folder**
   - Drag and drop the files in `Neon White_Data`, replace all with naming conflicts
5. **Have fun playing the new levels!**

## F.A.Q.

- I can't find the present for a level
  - message tentex on discord, and I can show you a screenshot of where I stood to place the present
  - or look in `coordinates.py` to see the in game coordinates for the presents, and use a speedometer to help find the present
- How do I create my own custom levels?
  - check `MODDING.md` for a guide
- The present in a level is literally impossible to get!
  - Oops! I kinda just eyeballed they were in the right spot so some might be a bit too high...
- I have questions about something else...
